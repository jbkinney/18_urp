    "Python is a user-friendly language. It is designed for maximum readability. More than almost any language out there, valid python code looks like pseudocode. Many aspects of the language help to enforce clarity. There is also a set of convensions, called the PEP 8 Style Guide, that most programmers have adopted in order to make their code as clear as possible. I recommend trying to follow PEP 8 as much as possible, if only to make your code easier to decipher when you come back to it after a year or two of disuse. "

    "Python is a rapid prototyping language. It is designed to allow you to write programs as quickly and as painlessly as possible. One feature of Python that enables rapid prototyping is that it is an \"interpreted\" language: each line is executed by the Python \"interpreter\" one after the next. This is different than C, C++, or Java, which require that programs first be \"compiled\", i.e. translated in their entirety from code to byte code before they are run. "

This was NOT the case 12 years ago when I first started learning Python. But now I am able to use Python for virtually all of my programming needs. And when I have a question about how to code something (which is about once every 2 minutes), Google is usually able to satisfy my question within a minute or two. "

Unless you know what you are doing, I suggest not even installing Python 3.5 on your computer.**"

    "This is an **IPython Notebook**. You can learn more about these notebooks on the Jupyter project website, http://jupyter.org/. IPython notebooks provide a very conveneint interface to python. It allows you to include fully functional python code inside of a document that contains \"markdown\" (i.e. text like this) and figures that show analysis results. Note how the menu above allows use to specify whether each cell is a \"code\" cell (i.e. contains Python code) or a markdown cell. This type of hybrid document provides a very powerful method of interactive data anlysis. I strongly suggest using IPython Notebooks for most of your data anlysis tasks. Only when you start writing production code does it make sense to move away from the Notebook format. "
