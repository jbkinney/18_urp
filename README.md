A Python tutorial, designed for the 2017 Undergraduate Research Program at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

To follow this tutorial, you need to install Anaconda for Python 2.7. Anaconda is a software package that supports the iPython Notebooks that we will be using. Anaconda is free and can be downloaded from here: https://www.continuum.io/downloads. Warning: Install for Python 2.7, NOT Python = 3.6. These two versions of Python are not compatible.
